title: 'Exploring causal inference with DAGs and Bayesian models'
---

Lately, I've been reading quite a lot about causal inference in statistics and
the various approaches developed through the decades. Pearl's framework, which
relies on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) resonated with me the most; I really
like DAGs as a way of expressing ideas about causality, and as a tool for
tackling causal questions and building causal models.

As I've been focused on Bayesian modeling for the past couple of years, I've
found the generative modeling approach to be quite a useful way of approaching
data analysis. The directed acyclic graph approach and the generative modeling
approach seem to have a lot in common. However, I still feel like a difference
is being made between the two. Because of this (and other pedagogic reasons),
I've decided to explore some simple causal setups to gain (hopefully) a better
understanding of both causal inference and the DAG/generative modeling
frameworks.

# Case 1 - three variables with simple confounding

The first case I'm going to look at is a simple three-variable case where one
variable acts as a confounder of the causal relationships of the remaining two
variables. I'm talking about the case pictured below:

```{dot fig_dag_no-coef}
//| fig-align: center
//| fig-cap: Three variables, simple confounding.
//| label: fig-three-var-confounding

digraph G {
    layout=dot;
    rankdir=LR;
    X -> Y;
    Z -> X;
    Z -> Y;
}
```

So, I'm assuming that the $X$ variable exerts a causal effect on the $Y$
variable, and that the $Z$ variable has a causal effect both on $X$ and $Y$.
Therefore, $Z$ creates a backdoor path from $X$ to $Y$, which means that it has
to be adjusted for in order to get an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of
$X$ on $Y$.

Before simulating some values for the variables, I'll load some Julia packages:

```{julia setup}
using Pkg

Pkg.activate("..")

using Distributions
using Random
using Statistics
using StatsModels
using Turing
using GLM
using DataFrames
using Markdown

include(joinpath("..",
                 "helpers",
                 "text-formatting.jl"))

Random.seed!(1)
```

Now, let's simulate data from the data generating process described in
@fig-three-var-confounding. For simplicity, I'll assume all variables are
distributed normally with the same standard deviation $\sigma = 1$, but with
different means. Also for simplicity, I'll assume that the relationships between
the variables can be described by a simple linear model. Therefore, we have:

\begin{align}
    Z &\sim \text{normal}(1, 1) \\
    x_i &\sim \text{normal}(\mu_{x_i}, 1) \\
    y_i &\sim \text{normal}(\mu_{y_i}, 1) \\
    \mu_{x_i} &= 3 z_i \\
    \mu_{y_i} &= 2 x_i + 4 z_i
\end{align}

```{dot fig_dag_effects}
//| fig-cap: Causal effects for three variables, simple confounding scenario.
//| label: fig-three-var-confounding-effs
digraph effects_G {
    layout=dot;
    rankdir=LR;
    X -> Y [label="b_xy = 2"];
    Z -> X [label="b_zx = 3"];
    Z -> Y [label="b_zy = 4"];
}
```

With that in mind, I'll simulate the data and put it in a data frame:

```{julia generate-data}
Z_distr = Distributions.Normal(3, 1);

N = 1000 # number of simulated draws

Z = Random.rand(Z_distr,
                N)

# create X values
x_mu = 3 * Z

X_distr = Distributions.Normal.(x_mu, 1)

X = Random.rand.(X_distr)

# create Y values
y_mu = 2 * X + 4 * Z

Y_distr = Distributions.Normal.(y_mu, 1)

Y = Random.rand.(Y_distr)

d = DataFrames.DataFrame(["Y" => Y,
                          "X" => X,
                          "Z" => Z])

d[1:10, :]
```

Now, Pearl's DAG framework tells us that fitting a, in this case, linear model
with $X$ as a predictor and $Y$ as criterion would give us a biased estimate of
the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ due to the backdoor path over $Z$
($X \textleftarrow Z \textrightarrow Y$). Therefore, fitting a linear regression
model should give an estimate of the $b$ coefficient for $X$ different than $2$,
which was coded while creating the data.

```{julia fit_confounded}
f = StatsModels.@formula(Y ~ X)

fit_y_x = GLM.lm(f,
                 d)
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false

x_idx = findall(x -> x == "X",
                coefnames(fit_y_x))[1]

Markdown.parse("""As can be seen, we get
               \$X = $(coef(fit_y_x)[x_idx] |> round_2)\$, which is different
               than the value set in the simulation.
               """)
```

According to Pearl's framework, we should also be able to get to the causal
effect of $X$ on $Y$ if we control for the confounder $Z$. Therefore, let's try
fitting another model, this time including $Z$ as a variable in the regression
model alongside $X$.

```{julia fit_non-confounded}
f = StatsModels.@formula(Y ~ X + Z)

fit_y_xz = GLM.lm(f,
                  d)
```

Now we get a $b_{YX}$ coefficient which corresponds to the one we've coded up
while simulating the data. The estimate of the effect of $Z$ on $Y$ is also in
line with the value which we've coded up.

Okay, now to the part that's a bit more tricky. I want to explore the
relationships between Bayesian networks and Bayesian generative models. If my
understanding is correct, a Bayesian generative model specified in line with the
actual data generating mechanism should be able to provide unbiased estimates of
causal effects. I'll try coding up the model represented by the DAG using
`Turing.jl`.

```{julia model_three-var-simple-confound}
Turing.@model function gen_model_y_xz(X, Y, Z)
    s ~ Turing.Exponential(1)

    b_XZ ~ Turing.Normal(2, 1)
    b_YX ~ Turing.Normal(2, 1)
    b_YZ ~ Turing.Normal(2, 1)

    Z ~ Turing.Normal(2, s)

    for i in eachindex(X)
        X[i] ~ Turing.Normal(Z[i] * b_XZ,
                             s)
 
        Y[i] ~ Turing.Normal(X[i] * b_YX + Z[i] * b_YZ,
                             s)
    end
end
```

And sample from the model:

```{julia sample_three-var-simple-confound}
#| message: false
#| cache: true

chains = Turing.sample(gen_model_y_xz(d.X,
                                      d.Y,
                                      d.Z),
                       Turing.NUTS(1000,
                                   0.80),
                       Turing.MCMCThreads(),
                       3000,
                       4)
```

Indeed, the parameters estimated in this way correspond to the ones we've
simulated earlier. Now, this probably isn't that surprising, given that what
we're doing is, basically, generating the data anew. Still, that *is*
comforting, I guess.

I'll try repeating the analysis using a distribution for the $Z$ variable which
I know to be incorrect - the t-distribution.

```{julia model_three-var-simple-confound_t}
Turing.@model function gen_model_y_xz_t(X, Y, Z)
    s ~ Turing.Exponential(1)

    b_XZ ~ Turing.Normal(2, 1)
    b_YX ~ Turing.Normal(2, 1)
    b_YZ ~ Turing.Normal(2, 1)

    Z ~ Turing.TDist(10)

    for i in eachindex(X)
        X[i] ~ Turing.Normal(Z[i] * b_XZ,
                             s)
 
        Y[i] ~ Turing.Normal(X[i] * b_YX + Z[i] * b_YZ,
                             s)
    end
end
```

```{julia sample_three-var-simple-confound_t}
#| cache: true

chains = Turing.sample(gen_model_y_xz_t(d.X,
                                        d.Y,
                                        d.Z),
                       Turing.NUTS(1000,
                                   0.80),
                       Turing.MCMCThreads(),
                       3000,
                       4)
```

Luckily, this also seems to work. So we can be a bit off.
