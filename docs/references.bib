  abstract = {This article reviews the foundations of causal mediation analysis and offers a general and transparent account of the conditions necessary for the identification of natural direct and indirect effects, thus facilitating a more informed judgment of the plausibility of these conditions in specific applications. I show that the conditions usually cited in the literature are overly restrictive and can be relaxed substantially without compromising identification. In particular, I show that natural effects can be identified by methods that go beyond standard adjustment for confounders, applicable to observational studies in which treatment assignment remains confounded with the mediator or with the outcome. These identification conditions can be validated algorithmically from the diagrammatic description of one’s model and are guaranteed to produce unbiased results whenever the description is correct. The identification conditions can be further relaxed in parametric models, possibly including interactions, and permit one to compare the relative importance of several pathways, mediated by interdependent variables.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

  abstract = {The concept of causality has a controversial history. The question of whether it is possible to represent and address causal problems with probability theory, or if fundamentally new mathematics such as the do-calculus is required has been hotly debated, e.g. [Pearl, 2001] states ‘the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as “mud does not cause rain” and “symptoms do not cause disease” and those facts, strangely enough, cannot be expressed in the vocabulary of probability calculus’. This has lead to a dichotomy between advocates of causal graphical modeling and the do-calculus, and researchers applying Bayesian methods. In this paper we demonstrate that, while it is critical to explicitly model our assumptions on the impact of intervening in a system, provided we do so, estimating causal effects can be done entirely within the standard Bayesian paradigm. The invariance assumptions underlying causal graphical models can be encoded in ordinary Probabilistic graphical models, allowing causal estimation with Bayesian statistics, equivalent to the docalculus. Elucidating the connections between these approaches is a key step toward enabling the insights provided by each to be combined to solve real problems.},
