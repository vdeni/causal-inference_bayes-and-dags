# causal-inference_bayes-and-dags

This is my attempt of pieceing together various readings on topics of causal inference and Bayesian modeling. At times, it's vague and probably hand-wavy. However, it helped me contextualize a lot of the thing I've been reading about, and I hope someone else will find it useful, too.
